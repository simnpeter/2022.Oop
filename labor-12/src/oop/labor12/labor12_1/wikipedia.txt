Hurricane Leslie (2018) was a cyclone of tropical origin, the strongest to strike the Iberian Peninsula since 1842. A large, long-lived, and very erratic tropical cyclone, Leslie developed from an extratropical cyclone that was situated over the northern Atlantic on 22 September. It became a Category 1 hurricane early on 3 October before falling to tropical storm intensity late on 4 October. After re-intensifying, Leslie reached hurricane status for the second time on 10 October, reaching peak intensity two days later and passing between the Azores and Madeira. It thereafter weakened, making landfall over central Portugal before dissipating by 16 October over Spain. The storm was responsible for 17 deaths in mainland Europe, including 2 direct deaths in Portugal and 15 indirect deaths in France. Over 300,000 citizens were left without power in Portugal, with damage there estimated to be about â‚¬120 million (US$145 million). The storm and a cold front also caused flooding in France and Spain.
